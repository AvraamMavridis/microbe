Microbe - 0.2.4

Microbe (µ) - a javascript library

Microbe is born from a trip in Hamburg where someone showed simple
shortcuts everyday functions, such as querySelector or querySelectorAll.
So why not go further and make better and learn how this
``<insert JS framework here>`` magic works ?

This is being developed as both an ongoing learning experiment, as well as
something actively used in projects. The goal being to write an efficent
library in ES6 to be ready for the future. Due to the nature
of it's development, Microbe is only using ES6 functionality that can be
shimmed.

Microbe, which is aiming to be somewhat general and expandable,
is separated into several categories:
- Core helpers (iterator, each, … )
- HTML helpers, *aka a DOM manipulation that might be split even more in the
future* (selectors, attributes, … )
- HTTP helpers making use of Promises (get, post, … )
- Observe ( observe, get, set, … )
